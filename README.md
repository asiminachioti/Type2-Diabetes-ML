# Predicting Type 2 Diabetes with Machine Learning 👩🏼‍💻🩺💉

🧠 Imagine a world where machines aren’t just tools, but partners in healthcare.

💡 What if we could teach a machine to understand the subtle clues in a person’s health data and predict the onset of Type 2 diabetes before it's too late?  

In this project, we take a deep dive into the **Pima Indians** Diabetes Dataset, where we guide a machine to discover hidden patterns in health indicators, and ultimately teach it to predict whether someone is at risk for developing diabetes.

The **Pima** are a Native American tribe originally from the Southwestern United States, mainly in Arizona. They are part of the larger Akimel O’odham group and have a rich cultural history tied to agriculture and river-based living. The women in this community have historically had higher birth rates, which is reflected in medical data such as this diabetes dataset.

We use **scikit-learn**, a powerful Python library for machine learning, and demonstrate essential steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

For the modeling part, we use two popular classification algorithms:
- **Decision Tree Classifier** 🌲
- **Random Forest Classifier** 🌳

We also evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like **accuracy** 🎯, **confusion matrix** 📊, and **classification report** 📋, in order to compare their strengths and weaknesses.

### 🤔 Why this project?

Diabetes is a growing health concern worldwide. Early detection can help improve patients' quality of life and reduce health complications. This project explores how machine learning can assist in predicting diabetes based on health measurements, such as glucose levels, BMI, and age.

By using simple yet powerful models like Decision Trees and Random Forests, we aim to gain insights and highlight the importance of data-driven health predictions.
